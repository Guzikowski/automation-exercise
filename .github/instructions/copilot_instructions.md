# Copilot Instructions

These are specific instructions for GitHub Copilot to assist contributors in this repository:

- Prefer concise, readable code and follow existing code style.
- Use comments to explain non-obvious logic.
- When suggesting changes, only show the changed lines and use `// ...existing code...` to represent unchanged regions.
- Group changes by file and always include the file path as a comment at the top of each code block.
- Do not repeat large blocks of existing code; be as concise as possible.
- When creating new files, place them in the most appropriate directory.
- For configuration or environment changes, provide clear, minimal examples.
- Always prioritize clarity, maintainability, and testability in code suggestions.
